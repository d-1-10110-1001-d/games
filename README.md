# Conway's game of life

## About
This is my implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). According to Wikipedia:
>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Execute
Make sure Python 3 is installed. Clone this repository. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing main.py and run `python main.py` to execute.
